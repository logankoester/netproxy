========

netproxy is a Netflix/Hulu/Pandora/etc proxy in a box. Simply build the Docker image on a US server, set your
computer's DNS IP to it, and enjoy your favorite US-only sites.

netproxy uses the excellent `tunlr-style-dns-unblocking` script to do the heavy lifting, calling it behind the scenes
to set up a Docker container:

Running
--------

Running netproxy is easy. If you have Docker installed, just clone the repository, edit `config.json` to replace
`YOURIPHERE` with the external IP of your *server*, and run:

    docker build -t skorokithakis/netproxy .

This will build the image. Once it's done, run:

    docker run -p 53:53/udp -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -d skorokithakis/netproxy

and that's pretty much it! You are now ready to connect to it. Set your computer's primary DNS server to your server's
IP, and you can watch all the Netflix you want.

Caveats
-------
There are two problems with this setup:

1) Running a DNS server exposed to the entire internet is a very bad idea.
2) Setting your primary DNS to a server in the US will slow your internet down significantly.

To avoid these problems, you can change your hosts file to point everything to your netproxy IP, and you can omit
forwarding port 53. That means you should run docker like so:

    docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -d skorokithakis/netproxy

which should be much safer and faster. To generate the hosts file, just run:

    python writehosts.py

in the same directory as config.json (after having replaced your IP in the file), and a hosts file will be generated.
Just append it to your normal hosts file *on your local machine* (the one you want to watch on) like so:

    sudo cat hosts >> /etc/hosts

And everything should now go through the proxy.
